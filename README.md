# Portfolio

I began a programming boot camp at The Tech Academy in May 2017. Here are the major projects I've worked on since, in order of complexity, not chronological. Much of my experience has focused on back-end functionality rather than front-end aethstetics.

# Inventory Management System (C#-MVC)
The Inventory Management system was a Live Project I worked on for developing a database for managing inventory and creating weekly profit reports for a small restaurant or food cart. It is a code first MVC approach to the problem.

Find the project in the <a href="https://github.com/dmcochener/InventoryManagementSystem">Inventory Mangement System</a> Repository.

# Wine Tracker (C#-MVC)
My final project in the C# module of the boot camp was a code first MVC project of my own choosing. I have a growing collection of wine, and want to start being able to inventory it. This was instructional for my final Live Project as well.

# Papa Bob's Mega Pizza Challenge (C#- Web Forms)
Working with the videos at Developer University by Bob Tabor, the final C# challenge using web forms was creating a pizza company online ordering form. The project called for using muliple layers of code to keep back-end code from being accessible by the end-user.

# Copy Script (Python- SQLite)
In Python, I learned how to build GUI's, work with existing libraries, work with SQLite, and work with local files. I developed a program for copying files from one folder to another through a GUI, based on if they've been modified wince the last time files were copied.

# Pizza Drill (JavaScript)
JavaScript was one of the first introductions to creating call back functions. The pizza drill was a simple web page designed to allow for ordering a pizza online. It did not actually work with a database for storing the order, but had calculations for the total of the pizza.

# Fake Library (SQL)
The final project for the SQL module of my boot camp was specific model instructions on developing a database for a library system. The way the database is set up is far from ideal, and I may re-do this project in the future with what I believe to be a better model. But it does show my abilities to program in SQL.

# Personal Webpage 
At the end of my HTML/CSS/Bootstrap module, I developed my own webpage. I've updated it to include some minimal JavaScript. As I tend to prefer back-end development, I haven't worked much on some of the issues I have with this page (such as making it more mobile friendly), but I've kept the content up to date.
